#Need to be installed to work:
DaViTpy (https://github.com/vtsuperdarn/davitpy) and Pandas (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)


**THIS CODE COMES WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY**

PS: All the source code is included here, but in order to make DMSP, SWARM, and OMNI data for SuperDARN plots several additional files need to be downloaded.
If you have any questions about the code attached, feel free to contact me at kristian_reed@yahoo.no

rfefinder.py is the starting point for using the RFE search algorithm
